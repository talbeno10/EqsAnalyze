# EqsAnalyze

## Main Purpose
Earthquakes data analyzation through the years, deductive reasoning and parameters prediction using ML
You will find addition information in the project presentation

## Acquisition
Gathering information using API & Crawling
* Wikipedia
* German Research Centre for Geosciences
* United States Geological Survey
Concat all information to one database

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploring & improving the data
* Format normalization
* Duplicates & nulls handling
* Ouliners handling

## Visualisation
* Explaining the data through graphs
* Buiild interactive maps according to locationes, times & volumes

## Machine Learning
* Predict the volume of the next earthquake by location
* Predict the probability to low, medium & high earthquakes by location
